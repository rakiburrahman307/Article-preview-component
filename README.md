Thank you for exploring my project for the Article Preview Component! This project was part of a coding challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io), which is a fantastic platform for honing front-end development skills through real-world projects.

## About the Challenge

The challenge was to build out an article preview component that closely matches the provided design. The component should be responsive and include social media share links that appear when the share icon is clicked.

### Key Features:

## Built With

- **HTML** - For the basic structure.
- **CSS** - To style the component, including responsive design.
- **JavaScript** - To handle the interactive share button functionality.

## Where to Find Everything

- All assets can be found in the `/images` folder.
- The styles and colors are defined in the `style.css` file, which follows the color palette provided in the style guide.
- The interaction logic is written in JavaScript, with dynamic content loading upon submission.

## Project Setup
